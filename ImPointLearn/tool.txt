R=react client server UI 
Nodejs= backend server language
to make backend server first make nodemodule,package.json folder using(npm init ) install nodemon and with the help of express make server
install mongoess packeage to connent servear with mangosee(npm i mongoose) make a db file which connect which have a function connent with databaase 
make index.js file to entry point of backend
